    "section": "",
    "text": "In Blantyre, Malawi, Solid waste burning has become a necessary waste management strategy to reduce waste volume in areas with limited solid waste collection(Nagpure, Ramaswami, and Russell 2015) . Waste burning is a source of particulate matter emissions that cause respiratory infection (Ramadan, Rachman, and Matsumoto 2022) . However, researchers have not studied waste burning at either the city or intra-city scale in Malawi. There is an emerging literature addressing onsite waste disposal methods in Malawian cities, including Lilongwe [Kalonde et al. (2023)](Ndala and Ndala, n.d.). However, disposal methods in other Malawian cities, including Blantyre, Mzuzu and Zomba are under-studied.  Studying Open waste burning will generate data that can enable the local authorities to design location-specific interventions that would address the issue."
