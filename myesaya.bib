  abstract = {Open waste disposal has a negative effect on local ecology, economy, and public health. Understanding factors influencing waste disposal decisions is necessary for developing solutions to curb open waste disposal. This paper discusses the associations between household's social demographic and spatial characteristics with preference for domestic waste disposal. The paper also utilizes this knowledge practical community action. This was achieved by gathering and examining a novel dataset of the waste disposal patterns of 200 randomly chosen households in Malawi. We observed that households were likely to dispose of their waste openly when the residential unit was closer to an existing open waste disposal site. A multinomial logistic regression model showed that the likelihood of choosing waste disposal methods, such as private garbage collection services, is higher when the household head is a woman, the housing unit is owned by the occupants, or in situations where a fence is present around the housing unit. We presented these findings to the neighborhood community development committee. A short-term community waste management plan was created using a participatory community planning approach. The plan included co-designing waste disposal solutions with landlords, setting up community waste bylaws, and intensifying civic education activities. In conclusion, our study provides insights into the factors that influence households' disposal behavior. This unique case study highlights a potential approach for developing waste management policies using a bottom-up approach.},

  abstract = {Open-burning of municipal solid waste (MSW) is a major source of PM emissions in developing world cities, but few studies have characterized this phenomenon at the city and intracity (neighborhood) scale relevant to human health impacts. This paper develops a consistent field method for measuring the spatial frequency of the incidence of MSW-burning and presents results in three neighborhoods of varying socioeconomic status (SES) in Delhi, India, observed in winter and summer over 2 years. Daily MSW-burning incidents ranged from 24 to 130/km2-day during winter and 5-87/km2-day during summer, with the highest intensity in low SES neighborhoods. Distinct seasonal and diurnal patterns are observed. The daily mass of MSW-burned was also estimated at 90-1170 kg/km2-day and 13-1100 kg/km2-day in highest to low SES neighborhoods, in winter and summer, respectively. The scaled-up estimate of total MSW-burned for Delhi city ranged from 190 to 246 tons/day, about 2\%-3\% of total generated MSW; morning-burning contributed {$>$}65\% of the total. MSW composition varied systematically across neighborhoods and season. Agra had much higher MSW-burning (39-202 incidents/km2-day; 672-3485 kg/km2-day) in the summer. The field method thus captures differences in MSW-burning across cities, neighborhoods, diurnally and seasonally, important for more fine grained air pollution modeling, and for tracking/monitoring policy effectiveness on-ground.},

  abstract = {The study assessed the roles of community members on community level waste disposal in the city of Lilongwe in Malawi. The communities are basically low income and densely populated where a lot of people depend on small scale businesses. The study used a mixed methods approach. The target population was the community members of eighteen years of age and above. The sample size was 40 and the participants were selected using simple random sampling. Likert scale was used which helped in weighing forty questionnaires which were administered to the respondents. The data collected was analyzed using content analysis and statistical package for social science (SPSS). The results from the study show that community members of Lilongwe City have to work together and embrace different effective skills in mitigating poor waste disposal. In total 63\% of the respondents indicated that the community lacked waste management skills while 93\% of the respondents stated that an increase in the population leads to an increase in the waste produced in the communities accordingly. A total of 65\% indicated that members of the community were not willing to pay for waste management in their areas while 70\% attributed the waste management responsibility to the government. The study recommends that the stakeholders should plan for awareness programs; community members should identify their capabilities to turn waste into briquettes which they can use for cooking and selling to generate income; the government should provide loans to disadvantaged communities for small scale businesses in waste re-cycling and that the government should provide free waste collection services to the underprivileged urban communities.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to assess household solid waste management in areas governed by local administrative organizations (LAOs). The obtained results would be used to assess the amount of air pollution emitted from household solid waste open burning. A survey was employed, through the use of questionnaires, to collect data from a random sample of 4300 households residing in areas governed by 96 LAOs. According to the results, it was evident that a total of 26.17 Mt of solid waste were generated per year, of which 6.39 Mt/year was not collected by the LAOs and was eliminated by households. Moreover, the percentage of waste burned on or outside the households' property was 53.7\%, or an equivalent of 3.43 Mt/year of solid waste burned in open areas. In addition, it was found that 0.66 Mt/year of solid waste collected by the LAOs was burned in open areas and was not eliminated properly. Hence, the total amount of solid waste from these two sources was 4.09 Mt/year, which resulted in the emissions of carbon dioxide equivalent, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitric oxide, and particulate matter of 1247.3 kt/year, 103.0 kt/year, 1.2 kt/year, 7.4 kt/year, and 19.6 kt/year, respectively.},

  abstract = {In this study, total burned household waste and the potential emissions released from waste burning in Semarang City, Indonesia, were estimated. Waste piles were monitored using the transect walk survey method in 16 sub-districts of Semarang City. Carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide \-(CO2), hydrocarbon (HC), nitrous oxide \-(NOx), and total particulate matter (TPM) were directly analyzed through a simulation of waste combustion. The potential emissions from other pollutants were predicted by multiplying the weight of the burned waste by the emission factors available in the literature. The estimated waste burned in Semarang City in 2020\textendash 2021 was 58.8 Gg/year, or approximately 9.70\% of the total waste generated in Semarang City. This estimation exceeds local government estimates of 2020 by two-fold. Peri-urban areas (both inner and outer) were identified as the most significant contributors to waste burning. Further, garden waste was the most burned waste (73.61\%), followed by plastic waste (17.45\%). Other wastes, including paper, leather, textile, rubber, and food, were also burned. Overall, a decrease in the activity of waste burning is an important step for reducing the potential of air pollution and climate change.},
